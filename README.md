# Crush2020

When we crushed the midterms two years ago, we figured the formula would be easily replicated for the 2020 election. Little did we know that a pandemic would bring political organizing as we know it to a grinding halt, making many of the typical means of volunteering and supporting campaigns nearly impossible.

Itâ€™s because of this deadly serious wrench that we need democracy-supporting tools more than ever, which is why we've built Crush2020.

Much like Crush the Midterms, Crush2020 asks users a series of questions to determine their geography, their availability leading up to Election Day, the skills they can lend to campaigns, and how much money they can budget to donate to competitive races. But with the myriad challenges facing voters this year, it also helps them request absentee/mail-in ballots, keep track of important voting deadlines, and suggests alternative forms of volunteering that suit our socially-distanced world.
